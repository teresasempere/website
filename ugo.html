                                <p>
                                        UGO is a platform that helps people with learning disabilities be more
                                        autonomous. UGO enables them to move independently inside of buildings.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                        A support person installs and configures the UGO app on their phone, taking into
                                        account their unique needs. Once configured, the user will be able to go
                                        anywhere inside a building with the aid of the app. Once chosen where to go, UGO
                                        will show a series of simple instructions, accompanied by a visual and voice
                                        aid.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                        To be able to ensure the orientation inside of buildings, UGO uses beacon
                                        technology. This way the user can get real-time information of their position.

                                        <b>What I want: </b> to design a mobile application that helps people with
                                        disabilities to orient themselves and move around buildings, through a
                                        notification system as assistance.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                        Firstly, I did a little research on applications and different technologies that
                                        already exist for the orientation and navigation of people with disabilities.
                                        The applications are mostly aimed at blind users or users with mobility
                                        problems, as well as being focused on the outside orientation.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                        After this research, it was necessary to understand everything I knew, what I
                                        intuited and the limitations and barriers present on the subject
                                </p>

                                        One of the key parts for the development of the project was getting contact with
                                        specialists in the field and with users. In this case, I was lucky enough to be
                                        able to meet with professionals from two organizations <b>CEAPAT</b> or ‚ÄúCentro
                                        de Referencia Estatal de Autonom√≠a Personal y Ayudas T√©cnicas‚Äù ("State Reference

                                        The research method used has therefore been to carry out two <b>semi-directed

                                        and give rise to dialogue and thus be able to obtain as much information as
                                        possible.

                                <p>A concept that I learned during these interviews is 'Easy read'. It is a way of

                                        something that benefits everyone.</p>

                                        This application should be easy to understand and its interface should meet

                                        in the most effective and simple way to get to the place they want.
                                        It all will be integrated into an environment for the support person to remotely

                                <p>
                                        Beacons play a very important role in the project as they are the key to the
                                        operation of navigation in the user application. Through triangulation and
                                        proximity.
                                </p>

                                <div class="article_image">
                                        <img src="./assets/img/ugo/beacons.svg" alt="">
                                </div>

                                <p>The beacons allow the application to recognize the building in which the user is
                                        located and to automatically display the different places they can go to.</p>

                                <p>They also enable the automation of supports. That is, once the user wants to go
                                        somewhere (for example, 'Go to the bathroom'), the app will give them 'feedback'
                                        in real-time on the steps to follow. It will also be detected if the person is
                                        lost (going too far from the right direction) and needs help.</p>

                                        an acronym of the Spanish word'Ubicaci√≥n' (Location in English) and 'Go'.
                                        Pronounced in English it sounds like the call to action ‚ÄòYou go‚Äô and that when
                                        pronounced in Spanish it reminds us of the name ‚ÄòHugo‚Äô, which personifies it. It
                                        is therefore an international name, friendly and easy to remember.

                                <p> <b>Professional growth:</b> the development of the project has helped me to validate and consolidate the knowledge that I have acquired in my master degree. On this basis, I have also managed to broaden my knowledge in areas such as design for accessibility and in the languages ‚Äã‚Äãof CSS and HTML.</p>
                                <p> <b>Personal growth:</b> if there is something that I take from this process, it is all I have learned from a world that until now felt very far away, the world of people with intellectual disabilities. And I can only feel grateful for the great opportunity I have had to work with them.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                        Finally, I would like to thank the people of the organizations that have helped me in the development of this project. To the professors of the Interactive Design Master, for their support, direction, help and advice. To the professionals of CEAPAT, to Paula, a worker of the ADEMO foundation, for getting involved and providing all the information and knowledge that were within her reach. Finally, to To√±i (a worker at the ADEMO Foundation occupational centre in Moratalaz), Juan Carlos and Jorge, who were very diligent to take the user test.
