                                        Capturing the interest of younger audiences is not an easy task for art museums.
                                        In the
                                        Prado Museum
                                        there are already didactic materials that have been developed with this problem
                                        in mind
                                        so that,
                                        playing, the little ones have a positive experience and become interested in
                                        learning
                                        about the
                                        paintings and characters that inhabit the museum.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                        However, adolescents (from 13 to 18 years old) are a different case, difficult
                                        to
                                        please. Art museums
                                        for them can seem strange, old, not welcoming, for older people, even boring.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                        In the museum there is no specific tool designed that helps
                                        them explore the museum in an autonomous, personalized and exciting way.
                                </p>

                                <p>
                                        With all this in mind, I saw the opportunity to design a project that manages to
                                        make
                                        teenagers interested in the museum's collections, learn, have
                                        fun, feel the museum as their own and return
                                        frequently.

                                        The best way to explain what is PlayArte is to accompany Eduardo on his visit to
                                        the museum.

                                        The interface is divided into four main screens. <b>The map</b>, the main
                                        feature. Here the user can see the interactive objects and characters there are

                                        they will unlock more and more content to further customize their avatar.

                                        One of the most important features of the project is the personalized experience
                                        it offers the user. For this reason, the first time a user opens the app they
                                        will be able to choose the type of art they are more interested in. This way,
                                        the characters they will encounter will be more likely the ones related to their
                                        preferred artwork.

                                <p>
                                        The quests are what the app is based around. They are the motivation for the user to walk around, here about different artworks and interact with the museum in a different way. The mechanism is simple, a user finds a character who asks them a favour (talk to another person, find a specific object, go to a painting...) Once the user does this task, sometimes they will have to return back to the character and other times they will start a new quest related. At the end of each quest, users will receive a prize, normally a piece of clothing, hairstyle or object they can customize their avatar with.

                                        These characters are renowned personalities that wander around the museum eager to talk with anyone. They are painters, kings, queens, animals, greek gods... They escape their paintings and the user can see them through PlayArte.
